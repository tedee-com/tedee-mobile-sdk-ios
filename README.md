## Getting Started

Getting started with the Tedee Mobile SDK is straightforward:

### Installation

Add Tedee Mobile SDK package to your project using repository url: [https://github.com/tedee-com/tedee-mobile-sdk-ios](https://github.com/tedee-com/tedee-mobile-sdk-ios)

### Integration

Import TedeeLock module

`@import TedeeLock`

### Initialization

To properly initialize project you will need:

- mobile public key (generated with `TedeeLockManager.publicKey`)
- lock serial number (you can find it in Tedee app)
- device public key, certificate and certificate expiry date (see example app how to get them from Tedee API)

Use `TedeeSerial` and `TedeeCertificate` objects to store configured data.

When all required data is provided you can try to connect to the lock using `TedeeManager's` `connect(:SerialNumber, certificate: TedeeCertificate, keepConnection: Bool)` method.
